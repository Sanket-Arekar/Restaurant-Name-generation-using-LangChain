            "Summary: The Supercopa de España, also known as the Spanish Super Cup, is a super cup tournament in Spanish football. Founded in 1982 as a two-team competition, the current version has been contested since 2020 by four teams: the winners and runners-up of the Copa del Rey and La Liga. \n",
            "Until 1995, a team that won both the league and cup automatically got the trophy. From 1996 to 2019, if a team won both, they had to play the cup runners-up for the Supercopa. Since its inception, thirteen teams have participated in the tournament, and ten have been crowned champions.\n",
            "Barcelona is the reigning champion after defeating Real Madrid in the final of the 2025 edition held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Barcelona is also the most successful team with fifteen titles, followed by Real Madrid with thirteen. Athletic Club and Deportivo La Coruña each have three titles, with Deportivo notably winning every edition they have participated in. Lionel Messi is the competition's all-time top scorer and the most successful player, with eight titles.\n",
            "\n",
            "Page: 2020 Supercopa de España\n",
            "Summary: The 2020 Supercopa de España was the 36th edition of the Supercopa de España, an annual football competition for clubs in the Spanish football league system that were successful in its major competitions in the preceding season.\n",
            "In February 2019, it was announced that the competition would be changed from a two-team format to four teams, which would include a semi-final round. The semi-final round was played on 8 and 9 January 2020, and the final was held on 12 January; there was no third-place game.\n",
            "The final was contested between Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, and was won by Real Madrid 4–1 on penalties, following a 0–0 draw after extra time, to win their eleventh Supercopa title.\n",
            "It was played in Saudi Arabia after the Saudi government offered to pay 40 million euros for each of the next three seasons.\n",
            "\n",
            "Page: Super cup\n",
            "Summary: A super cup is a competition, in association football, basketball, handball, volleyball and rugby union which often forms the 'curtain raiser' to a season, and typically involves only two teams who have qualified through success in other competitions during the previous season. \n",
            "It is typically contested on a national level by two competition winners of the previous season: the national knock-out cup winner and the highest level league champion. There are also continental super cups, like the UEFA Super Cup in football, which puts together winners of the top and second-tier UEFA competitions and the Recopa Sudamericana between CONMEBOL Libertadores and the Sudamericana winners, and cross-border super cups between champions of neighbouring leagues, such as the Campeones Cup between the winners of the highest level leagues in the United States and Mexico, and the Champions Cup for the champions of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \n",
            "The now-defunct Intercontinental Cup was a super cup played between the continental champions of Europe and South America, with winners retroactively recognised by world governing body FIFA as World Champions prior to the creation of the official FIFA Club World Cup and the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions between the winners of the European Football Championship and the Copa América, which rebranded once again in 2022 after the 29-year hiatus.\n",
            "Sometimes, these are two-legged ties, with a match played at each side's stadium, but increasingly they are one-off fixtures at a neutral venue, such as a national stadium. Some Super Cups have even been staged in venues outside their home country, such as the Italian, French, Spanish, Turkish, Mexican, and Egyptian games and increasingly function as publicity events for that league in the global market. \n",
